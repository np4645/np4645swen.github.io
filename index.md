# About Me
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hmsnohK.jpg" alt="Myself" width="200"/>

I was born on October 30th, 2002 in the city of Reading, Pennsylvania (think the Reading Railroad from the Monopoly Board!). 
I lived there throughout my entire life up until this past August, when I moved in on-campus at RIT. I went to Berks Catholic High School and graduated with high honors.
Some of my passions and hobbies include creative writing (especially poetry), solving Rubik's Cubes very quickly, and I am on one of RIT's Esports teams.
When I'm not in my dorm studying or working on a project, you'll likely find me hanging out with friends or walking up and down campus at 1 A.M. I chose 
software engineering as my career path because I love creating solutions to common problems and seeing my code utilized by a wide variety of people.

# Things I'm looking forward to in SWEN-101:
- The ability to collaborate with a team on a project and develop effective team-building and project-management skills.
- Learning how to properly network and reach out to those in the Software Engineering industry to expand my professional influence.
- Virtual candy

# Speaking of candy...my favorite food:

_Can't beat Fried Chicken!_ Especially if it's seasoned properly and served with a side of lemon. A close second is a dessert called "arroz con dulce" (a traditional Puerto Rican dessert, think of a sweet rice pudding). Here's a picture of that, too:
